<!-- Brief Description -->

## Overview

Sweater Weather is the backend of an application that correlates forecasts to specific locations, and also allows a user to plan road trips. The user is able to see the current forecast at any location as well as the arrival destination. 

- [Original Project Link](https://mod4.turing.io/projects/capstone.html)


### Wins

This project consumes two APIs and manipulates that data and reformats it for use in a custom built API. Consuming and building APIs in one application was a fun challenge. 

### Struggles

Deciding on the optimal architecture and structure of the API. Figuring out the best way to use facades and modules within this backend. 


## Technology Used

- Ruby 2.5.3
- Rails 6.0.3
- PostgreSQL database
- RSpec for testing

## Installation

- [Technical Requirements](https://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/sweater_weather/requirements)

    - This command will create an application.yml file - make sure this file is gitignored and populate with your own ENV variables for each API

## API Consumption
**The following APIs were used in this project:**
- [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api)
- [MapQuest API](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/geocoding-api/)
- [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers)

## API Endpoints 

**Forecast**
- api/v1/forecast?location=**city, state**
- Shows the current, hourly, and daily forecast for a location

**Background Image**
- api/v1/background?location=**city, state**
- Finds an image that is related to the searched location

**User Registration**
- api/v1/users
- Registers a new user and generates a unique API key for the user

**User Login**
- api/v1/sessions
- Authenticates a user and logs them into the application

**Road Trip**
